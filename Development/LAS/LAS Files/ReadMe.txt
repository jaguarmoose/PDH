The LAS files included with this report are, in most cases, devoid of most or all header information.  The creation of the LAS files, for the purposes of creating geologic cross-sections D-D' and E-E', did not require the input of these data. 
 
In an effort to prevent the possible corruption of the LAS file format, the header information was not added for these files, after the fact, but rather made available here through Tables 1 and 2.

Where gamma ray data are not available in a given .LAS file, the null value of "-999.2500" will appear.
